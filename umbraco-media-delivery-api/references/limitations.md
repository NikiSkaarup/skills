# Limitations and Notes

- Media Delivery API mirrors the Content Delivery API structure but with fewer options.
- The default implementation supports only `fetch=children` for queries.
- No extension model for querying is available by default.
- `id` parameters always refer to media item keys (GUID), not node ids.
